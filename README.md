### Demonstrate we are under mass surveillance

Privacy is a fundemental human right.

You are leaving your fingerprint on every website you visit. The website will
be connected to other services like ad sellers, analytics and social networks
that also collect the same fingerprint. 

Companies now have the power to show you customized content. They will use it.
For your good? Reduction of choices, less informed, less autonomy

Gonvernments are tapping big Internet companies but also telecommunication
on a low level.

[As an example: BBC (or other news site) number of tracking services?]
