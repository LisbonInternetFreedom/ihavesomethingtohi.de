### Demonstrate we are under mass surveillance

Privacy is a fundemental human right.

You are leaving your fingerprint on every website you visit. The website is
connected to other services like ad sellers, analytics and social networks
that collect the same fingerprint. This mass surveillance leaves companies
with a detailed profile of your online behaviour that accumulates data as soon
as you click on the next link.

[As an example: BBC (or other news site) number of tracking services?]

Companies nowadays use this power to show you customized content like ads, but
also to adapt your search results and offers you get. And they will use it for
any business model that brings them revenue. For your good?

Mass surveillance will result in a reduction of choices, as we are kept within
the digital cages that companies create for us. You will get less information
about any topic that you try to study online, any service you request will be
reduced and modified, and as a result this kind of surveillance will lead to
less autonomy for you as a user and citizen.

Besides companies, also gonvernments are tapping computers and big Internet
and telecommunication companies on a low level. This type of surveillance is
possible as devices in your computer are "protected" from you as a user and
because your data and telephone connections are running through closed
ecosystems under control of companies that (non-)deliberately cooperate with
secret services. As you as a user do not have control over this level anymore,
your privacy is completely on stake. At the moment, you just have to trust your
government, full self-defence is practically not possible anymore.

Would you accept it in real life?
