Besides companies, also gonvernments are tapping computers and big Internet and telecommunication companies.

This type of surveillance is possible as devices in your computer are "protected" from you as a user and because your data and telephone connections are running through closed ecosystems under control of companies that (non-)deliberately cooperate with secret services.

As you as a user do not have control over this level anymore, your privacy is completely on stake. At the moment, you just have to trust your government, full self-defence is practically not possible anymore.
