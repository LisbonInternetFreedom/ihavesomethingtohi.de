#### Reduction of choices

Companies nowadays use this power to show you customized content like ads, but
also to adapt your search results and offers you get. And they will use it for
any business model that brings them revenue. For your good?

Mass surveillance will result in a reduction of choices, as we are kept within
the digital cages that companies create for us. You will get less information
about any topic that you try to study online, any service you request will be
reduced and modified, and as a result this kind of surveillance will lead to
less autonomy for you as a user and citizen.
