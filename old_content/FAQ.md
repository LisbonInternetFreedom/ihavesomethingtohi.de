* Do I need to be a `geek` to install the tools to protect my data?

As you can see in the description of each [tools](https://github.com/pierreozoux/ihavesomethingtohi.de/blob/master/tools.md), it requires various level of knowledge.
But you can also find friends/people living nearby that could help you!

* Why are free softwares... free?

From the [free software foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

```
“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software.
Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”.
```

`Free` is a bit confusing word in English, that's why some people start to use the Spanish `livre`.

* Can I trust free software releasers? How can I be sure my data won't be tracked by the authors of free software?

You can trust them as much as proprietary software releasers, meaning you shouldn't ;)
But with free software, you can study them to see if they are tracking you.
If you don't have technical skills, you can ask a friend to do so, or even pay a professional.
At the end, it would be nice if you share your conclusions with other people then we can build trust together.

Whereas with proprietary software, this is impossible to do (or really complicated), so you have to trust blindly the releaser.

* Do I have to change a lot my habits if I start working with free software?

Depending on your habits ;)
If you just need to browse the Internet, switching from Chrome/Safari to Firefox is really easy.
If you use Office, switching to libre office requires a bit of time to adapt to the new interface.
If you use Windows, without being a power user, it will be equivalent. And if you are a power user, it's just a matter of time to learn the differences.

* Are free softwares as efficient as paid ones?

You need to buy some free software :) You probably mean proprietary software.
I would say, it depends.
For linux, this is the best operating system in the world. Did you know that [it powers Wall street](http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=12EFFC4E-1A64-6A71-CE351C82418B6342)?
It also powers 60% of web servers and 80% of smartphones! [linux market share](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Market_share_and_uptake)
For The Gimp, which is an alternative to Photoshop, I have to admit that it's still quite difficult to use.

* Am I going to be be identified as an activist if I start using free software?

Yes maybe, as revealed by Snowden, users of Linux are targeted for extra surveillance..[Source](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance).
But you have to remember that this is completely illegal, and it just shows us how we need more free software, and more users!
