## Rules are changing

In the past, rules of countries have changed drastically, for example the concept
of freedom. Future changes might affect your future self. Your present privacy
is important for future freedom.

If you took the most paranoid person from 5 years ago, after everything we
learned recently about spying on the Internet by governments and companies, that

When you send an email, it's like a postcard, several agents (digital and human)
copy and read it on the way. Would you accept it in real life?

Why acceptinh this in your digital life?
