# Do you have something to hide?

## [Yes](https://github.com/pierreozoux/ihavesomethingtohi.de/blob/master/tools.md)

## No

### Simple argument



If you took the most paranoid person from 5 years ago, after everything we
learned recently about spying on the Internet by governments and companies, that
person was actually right.

Would you allow a stranger to enter your home, and look around? When you send
an email, it's like a postcard, everbody might read it on the way. Would you
accept it in real life?

Keywords: less options, autonomy, freedom to think private, for you
and your neighbour(!), democracy]
